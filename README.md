# Cookbook(?)

This is a test to see whether a programmed cookbook would work better than my
current markdown based system.

Requirements:

- Search (the one thing that I'm missing right now)
- Ability to read from phone
- Ability to easily add new recipes
- Amendments
  - I mean, the ability to add notes from when I implement the dinners. Stuff
    like how it tasted, did I follow the recipe 100% or if I diverged from the
    original.
